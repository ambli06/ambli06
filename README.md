Hi I write code. If you want to see some things I'm not necessarily proud of but wrote for fun, see `ExperimentalCode`. Most other repositories are production code and in TypeScript React or Express. I will eventually sort things out with using backends that aren't JavaScript based but that will come with time.

Regarding my skills...

- I'm good at (in no particular order): **TypeScript, Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, C, React, NextJS, Node, Express, Matplotlib Figure Making, Adobe InDesign, Bash Scripting**
- I am okay at: **Julia, Adobe Illustrator**
- Languages I have been forced to use for a class and do not want to use ever again: **Racket/Scheme, Visual Basic**
