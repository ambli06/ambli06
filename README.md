Hi, I write code. I'm also a student at Northwestern. Scroll down if you want help or whatever kids want. If you want to see some things I'm not necessarily proud of but wrote for fun, see `ExperimentalCode`. Most other repositories are production code and in TypeScript React or Express. I will eventually sort things out with using backends that aren't JavaScript based but that will come with time.

_Regarding my skills..._

- I'm good at (in no particular order): **TypeScript, Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, C, React, NextJS, Node, Express, Matplotlib Figure Making, Adobe InDesign, Bash Scripting**
- I am okay at: **Julia, Adobe Illustrator**
- Languages I have been forced to use for a class and do not want to use ever again: **Racket/Scheme, Visual Basic**

I'm a CS major at Northwestern. Technically, my code for `CS111` and `CS211` are archived on GitHub but those repositories are private because of academic integrity. Don't email me for help. Thanks.
