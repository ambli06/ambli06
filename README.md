Hi, I write code. I'm also a student at Northwestern. Scroll down if you want help or whatever kids want. If you want to see some things I'm not necessarily proud of but wrote for fun, see `ExperimentalCode`. Most other repositories are production code and in TypeScript React or Express. I will eventually sort things out with using backends that aren't JavaScript based but that will come with time.

_Regarding my skills..._

- I love and am good at: **C++, Python, TypeScript, Java, React, NextJS, Adobe InDesign**
- I'm currently learning: **Julia, Rust, Elixir**
- I'm good at (but don't "love" per se): **Node, Express, Matplotlib Figure Making, Bash Scripting, JavaScript, C**
- Languages I have been forced to use for a class and do not want to use ever again: **Racket/Scheme, Visual Basic**
- I want to learn: **Angular, Carbon, C#, Perl, Ruby**
- Other: **Adobe Illustrator**

I'm a CS major at Northwestern. Technically, my code for `CS111`, `CS211`, `CS213`, and `CS214` are on GitHub but those repositories are private because of academic integrity. Don't email me for help. Thanks. I will give you one of my assignments though: it was the hardest project for `CS211` and the source code is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ).
