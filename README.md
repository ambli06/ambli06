- 👋 Hi, I’m Andrew, @andrewleaf22
- 👀 I’m interested in Chemistry, Physics, and Econometrics. If something doesn't have numbers...I probably won't like it
- 🌱 I’m currently trying to teach myself Angular.js and Node.js to develop apps for both my school as well as various organizations that I am a part of, though this has proved to be difficult.
- 💞️ I’m looking for people with similar interests!
- 📫 Find how to contact me on my website, andrewli.org (you have to click around)
